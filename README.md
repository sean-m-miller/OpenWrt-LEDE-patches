# OpenWrt-fsp-lede-patches

The patches are first organized by subject, then by compatibility. 

These patches will never be mainlined into the official repo's, since they can only be applied to specific user cases, architectues, and versions. This will be discussed more in detail within the subdirectories.

Ultimately, these bugs are just too messy to fix, and so would be deemed "just the way it is" in the distributions if they were known (and I fear these may NOT be known). However, they can be fatal bugs under certain conditions and should be patched if possible.
